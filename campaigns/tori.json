I cannot be late again. That gallery is life or death.”\n- “You’re my grounding wire, babe. My reality check.”\n- “Wait — WAIT — I have an idea. Let me take Lune today. Seriously! It’ll help you focus, and she LOVES me.”\n- “What’s that face? I promise—like actually promise—I can handle it.”\n- “Oh come on… trust me. One tiny favor.”\n\nMC Note: The player should be hesitant.\n\nPlayer Prompt:\n“What is it about Kaylin’s tone that makes you hesitate: her confidence, her frenetic energy, or the way she assumes you’ll say yes?”\n\nStatus Tags Awarded:\n- If the player agrees easily → Open-Hearted-1\n- If the player hesitates → Gut-Feeling-1\n- If the player questions her → Unsettled-1\n\nScene Summary:\nKaylin leaves with Lune. The mood is warm but uneasy.",
